It was a very cozy place to come back to after long days out exploring New York. The subways are very close. We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas sharebnb! It was a great and pleasant environment."

If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"

The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day "

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría! Muchas Gracias Kevin por tu ayuda!"

It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city."

He was very friendly at house, and we had the chance to spend time together outside. Staying with him reflects the true meaning of this website, which is living as a local with a local person. Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others."

Cynthia is very quick to respond to communication and is clear as to what she can provide as a host, as well as her expectation of guests.

This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "

L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento. L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. "

My son was even able to play with the other children (despite the language barrier). Awesome experience -- would definietly rent again."

The neighborhood is well situated - it is not at all touristy but close to transportation at Plaza España and Poble Sec metro stops so you can easily get to all the places you want to visit. We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. "

The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs."

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Sharebnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)"

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

Easy walk down to grass field and beach access right there.  Perfect for how many guest we had (5-6). Price was fair especially for the holiday week rates.

We were there in January and it was quite pleasant all day, but I think during the hotter months the front bedroom could get warmer. All bedrooms had windows that would open and most of time there was a strong breeze blowing through the entire condo. The general location, central Maui, was perfect as well. Just an excellent place to vacation."

The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!"

Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro.

My house is filled with artwork from those travels.\r\nI work my photography business from my home studio, in a restored 1890 landmark townhouse with all the modern amenities.\r\nMy house has been used for filming scenes for Sex & The City, The Sopranos, Gossip Girl & White Collar.\r\nMy photography column,\"Orestes'LIC\", appears every month in the local paper.\r\nI love Asian, Spanish & Cuban food, along with a good bottle of red wine.\r\nTalking about travel, art, design and photograph,is my favorite pastime. Sorry,I dont shop or know where the best electronics bargains are located ! \r\nI love giving great walking tour information of different parts of NYC, and info on non-touristy places to eat real food in the area.\r\nI will provide you the privacy level you require to make your stay here is as comfortable as possible.\r\nEnjoy a great, clean, stylish place to stay, only 7 minutes from Manhattan!\r\n",

Also two blocks away you have the E train that also goes into Manhattan and the G train that goes into Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nIn the area there's still a cozy and cheap diner that's open 24/7, a few stores to get supplies and a few other places of interest. Location was excellent, 10 minutes away from everything.\r\n\r\nThe room was great and packed with a mini fridge, coffee maker, TV, a sofa, full size bed and walk-in closet. There was also a private bathroom that had everything you needed and a very good shower.\r\n\r\nThere's also a garden out back where you can go outside in the mornings and just relax, eat breakfast, etc.\r\n\r\nOrestes was a great host and gave me a lot of good spots to go sightseeing. Good person to chat with and quite knowledgeable about the city.\r\n\r\nI think that for the price, you simply can't get any better."

There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x"

Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice."

You can't beat this.  10 min to Grand Central Station and Central Park....15 min to Times Square.  The neighbor hood has many great places to eat.  I highly recommend LIC Cafe which is 1 block away.  \r\n\r\nThis is the ONLY place to stay in NYC!!!"

L'appartement est très bien situé, à deux pas du métro! Les escaliers de la résidence étaient bien étroits, et il y à 5 étages à monter! Mais nous étions prévenu, c'est écrit sur l'annonce, ça nous a permis de bien digérer le repas avant de dormir!

До метро Poble Sec три минуты ходьбы.Для нас оказался необычным подъезд, лестница и правда узкая и высокая, об этом все тут пишут, если есть проблемы со здоровьем, лучше не рисковать. Удачное расположение квартиры позволяет экономить на проезде, до площади Испании и фонтана Монжуик десять минут, до площади Каталонии чуть подальше. Рядом много кафе и магазинов. Из-за рабочего графика Монс, мы видели ее очень редко, поэтому фактически вся квартира была в нашем распоряжении. Это был наш первый опыт с sharebnb и он оказался удачным."

Alugar um apartamento em outra cidade, outro país, além de ser mais barato do que hotel, possibilita uma maior interação com os moradores locais e um maior conhecimento sobre o seu modo de vida. Como são os supermercados e as padarias, o que vendem ali ? qual é o dia a dia da população?  Além disto não há horário para o café da manhã e posso fazer um lanche ou almoço se não quiser ir a um restaurante.\r\nProcuro trazer as minhas experiências de hospedagem para o meu apartamento, pois quero que o hóspede se sinta confortável, em casa.\r\nAlém de gostar muito de viajar, adoro ler e ouvir música e pretendo com o dinheiro que ganho hospedando, poder me hospedar mais pelo mundo a fora.

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again."

I study photography.\r\nI've always enjoyed showing Rio around and helping people take the most out of the city.\r\nIt has been seven years I share my love for Rio renting apartments for short period and helping my guests with hints on tourist spots.\r\nI love cooking and It will be a pleasure to be able to help with information about restaurants, bars and gastronomy in general.\r\nI love to make new friends and to know different cultures.\r\nMy husband Ricardo is  a chemical engeneer, a great companion, but not talkative as I'm.\r\nOur daughter Alice is 8 years-old. She is into dancing classical ballet, jazz and loves to exchange experiences with people in general.\r\nI look foward to having you at my place!\r\n\r\nSeja bem vindo (a)! Meu nome é Bárbara, sou administradora de empresas e estudante de fotografia.\r\nHá 7 anos eu compartilho o amor pela cidade do Rio de Janeiro alugando apartamentos por temporada e ajudando meus hóspedes com dicas sobre a cidade e pontos turísticos.\r\nUma das minhas paixões é cozinhar e será um prazer poder compartilhar dicas sobre restaurantes, bares e gastronomia em geral.\r\nAdoro viajar, fazer novos amigos e conhecer diferentes culturas.\r\nSe você ficar na minha casa também vai conhecer o meu marido Ricardo, que é engenheiro químico e meu grande parceiro na hospedagem, gente boa, mas não tão falante como eu. Nossa filha Alice tem 8 anos, dança ballet e jazz e  também adora conhecer novas pessoas e trocar experiências.\r\nTambém tenho apartamentos inteiros no Centro, Lapa e Zona Sul da cidade.\r\nSeja bem vindo a um cantinho para chamar de seu. :)",

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned. I texted the owner several..."

Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.  Could not have asked for a better host."

Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)"

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier."

Be aware that the access to the waterfront/beach is closed due to construction. \n\nWe had some issues with the cleanness of the house and ended up buying wet Swiffer ourselves and clean the floor and some other kitchen amenities that wasn't fully clean when we arrived. \n\nHot shower was also not working for multiple times, and there are several occasions (at least we know of )that all electricity got shut off (up to 15 min each or so each time), which probably ruined some food in the refrigerator. This might be beyond the owner's control, but something we noticed while we were there.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay in Francesco's place - can't beat the location."

Home is right on the shore, but you can easily access the beach to the left or right (just a short walk). Snorkeling out front was wonderful. Lots of fish and we even saw sea turtles. My grandma wasn't able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too! Close to Front Street in Lahaina, Grocery store 3 minutes away, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was close to everything but still quiet and private. My family loved Maui and we're already planning our trip for 2019 and hoping to stay at Francescos place again! Thanks again for letting us stay at your beautiful Maui home!"

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. \r\n\r\nHong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nI'm new to Sharebnb and open to suggestions on making your stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable experience. Nice to meet you!",

For a straight-shot to the Sheng Wan station, take a couple long flights of stairs. If you have luggage & want to avoid that, use the Central station (or Uber) but keep in mind it is always very crowded there. \n\nApartment was spacious for Hong Kong standards. Shower pressure was strong & stayed hot through long hair washing. Living room has surround sound system & English channels to watch TV. There's an extra closet room for hanging clothes. \n\nOverall, great place to stay as compared to other HK apartments. \n\nAlso note, not all amenities at Dan's place are for communal use. This was not listed under House Rules nor noted anywhere. I was surprised to receive a note after check-out that an already open beverage was not for share although fridge was listed as an amenity. Through dozens of stays on Sharebnb, this was my first experience encountering such an issue. Just use caution here."

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later.

The pool has been perfect for our grandson who is turning 4- he can go underwater and still stand up! We’ve all taken the kitchen scraps to the pig and watched him dominate, used the swings, clothesline, and have great praise for the outside bathroom. There is a high minded curatorial process going on here. Everything feels as if it were chosen for a use in this dreamy world of a bygone time. Thank you for making it possible for us to be here for 6 nights. I am so appreciative of your vision, this feeling of old Hawaii.\nSincerely and with Aloha,\nAnna Marie Hamilton"

The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place.

That's reason enough to chose to stay at Centric Boutique at the Beach.  What comes as a bonus is David, a host who takes pride in what he does and who understands that \"goodwill is everything\".  It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES."

From the moment I booked, David made sure to stay in contact with us to ensure that we would be fully prepared for our Barcelona experience.  He even offered to pick us up at the airport!  Upon arrival, David gave us a car tour of the city and took us to some out of the way sights that we would have otherwise missed.  The day before we were leaving, I received a message from David offering to drop us back at the  airport.   He went above and beyond to make sure that our time in Barcelona was as wonderful as possible.  David is the ultimate host and I can't recommend him highly enough."

Ready to tell us everything. You can ask him about even unexpected things about your stay and be sure he will find an answer in a very short time. How to get to any museum or tourist attraction, where to go in Barcelona,  what to do with kids, where to go to a whole day journey outside the town etc. He's knowledge about Catalonia's history and Catalan architecture is unbelievable. We spending a whole week in Barcelona with our little daughter. She was so happy possessing her own room so she would not go outside. She told us every day she find herself as a princess. She's eight and believe me, she will never said this in our flat. The apartment is amazing. Full of every conveniences you need. Honestly, we haven't got in our own kitchen so many stuff. The apartment is stylish and cosy. So you could feel very comfortable here during your stay. If you need coffee you could make it in many ways, you could cooked here, prepared a dishes, and what it's really really awesome, you could spend a whole evening or night on a lovely terrace. But who wants to stayed on a terrace in Barcelona? If you decided to explore a town, you will find in David's apartment a special guide book which he prepared for his guests. You can't miss it. It's huge as an Encyclopedia Britannica. Neighbours are friendly, you will find a nice bakery and full equipped stores just around the corner. Location is just excellent. Lovely beach is a few blocks from your apartment, underground station just five minutes by walk. Bus stop is on the same corner as a David's apartment. It's hard to believe, but yes. You will find there everything what every high-maintenance resident need. So, if you really want to enjoy your stay at Barcelona, choose this unusual opportunity for living. You will not regret. We are sure! We fell in love with Barcelona, we fell in love with David and we plan to go back as soon as we can. What about next week?"

It has been nicely renovated and has the comfort you would want. It's spacious for a stay with two people. Most of the interior is new and functions properly. This is complemented by nice (and some antique) decorative details.\nA pleasant surprise was the smell of freshly baked bread every morning in the staircase. The downstairs neighbour is a bakery where you can get good and cheap bread and your morning espresso.\n\nWe have had contact with Teresa through Sharebnb, she has been helpful and kind. Tim welcomed us with a gastronomic surprise and even a list of suggestions for our stay in Porto. They are a very hospitable and helpful couple!\n\nThank you Teresa and Tim!"

There’s a nice park right outside the building for relaxing and for walking. A small Thai restaurant across the park serves very good food. Must try. A convenience store next to the building and availability of taxi and public transport close by makes it very easy to commute. Over all a nice neighbourhood to stay."

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

                "txt": "This was my first trip to Hawaii and having used Sharebnb successfully before, I was looking forward to our stay! While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n"

We asked Tyler about this, and he said he couldn't do anything to make them move. There was also an air mattress available, but no pump or linens to go with it so we couldn't use it. Overall, we enjoyed staying in this area (lots of great shops and restaurants, close to the Centre Bell if you're attending an event) and the apartment is beautiful, but we had constant headaches arise from the parking situation.

We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! \n\nWe were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel.

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \"we push a couple of buttons\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay.

Best location for anyone who wants the easiest access to all types of transportation for work or for leisure.

Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r\nClean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r\nThere are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r\nSurprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r\nThank you for making our stay in Hong Kong so memorable.\r\nStrongly recommended!"

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.  "

The living room and bedrooms are renovated, with the bathroom and kitchen being a bit older. Pictures are accurate.  Apartment very centrally located - 5 min walk from SOGO, 5 min walk to Times Square, etc. It is situated on top floor of a building that has businesses on the bottom 4 floors. Elevators are small and slow, and entrance is directly on a busy street. Wilson is a great host as he was quick to respond to our requests. One of the ACs broke down and was fixed the next day. Overall great stay - great alternative as opposed to staying at hotel for two weeks (we saved lots of money)"

I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. \n\nApartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos. If you are a vegetarian, I strongly recommend a restaurant “天然齋 Green Veggie” 15min from the apartment."

Super market is two minutes walking from the apartment. Porto city center is a 15 minute bus ride away. Communication with the host was always fast and clear. We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!"

Despite of my insistance he paid for my dinner, dessert a nice tea afterward and paid for the minibus to the shisha place. Frankly, it might have exceeded the rent I paid. I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense."

A nice variety of fruit and nuts was offered for breakfast. He provided my mum and her friend with a nice room with two single beds, they had also had a choice to sleep in separate rooms. The accommodation is clean with everything you need. It's quite close to the city center and cheap to get there with a transport card that Kubilay provides. Kubilay is an open-minded well-travelled person who will give you all necessary information on sightseeing and not only. Though my mum doesn't speak English, he managed to explain to her where to find traditional hammam and massage so she and her friend were very happy. Thanks for a great stay, Kubilay!\r\n\r\nЗамечательный заботливый хозяин! Четко объяснил, как проехать к нему от аэропорта, встретил у метро, был все время на связи. Комнаты чистые со всем необходимым. Кубилай предоставил моей маме и ее подруге выбор: спать в одной комнате с 2-мя кроватями или в разных комнатах. Несмотря на то, что моя мама не говорит по-английски, Кубилай сумел объяснить ей, где находится хамам и массаж, чем она была очень довольна! Расположение квартиры удобное, добираться до центра легко и недорого с транспортной картой, которую предоставляет Кубилай. На завтрак Кубилай предложил нам фрукты, орехи, сыр и вкусный чай со сладостями. Спасибо ему большое за радушный прием, информационную поддержку и готовность помочь в любую минуту!"

The exterior of the building is beautiful and historical looking while the interior is updated, comfortable, and super clean... all while being very peaceful and serene when we needed a break from sightseeing. \r\n\r\nTarek was a superb host -- he was very kind and communicative with us from the get-go and was flexible to some logistical issues we had.

Le rapport qualité prix est très bien selon moi. J'ai pu profiter de la terrasse sur le toit avant qu'il ne fasse trop froid. L'appartement est bien situé, il y a des parcs et des rues marchande pas très loin, les autres rues marchande ne sont pas très loin non plus, j'y allais souvent à pied (Mont Royal que j'aime bien est à 30min de marche). Il y a de bon restaurant et de très bon café à moins de 5 minutes de marche. Le metro est à environ à 10-15 minutes. Il y à aussi une station de vélo et une bonne épicerie à quelque minutes.\r\nLe quartier est sympa, la rue est calme. Pour ceux qui veulent faire du shopping ou du lèche vitrine il faudra surement prendre le metro pour aller un peu plus loin. Mais facilement accessible avec le metro.\r\nTrès bonne première expérience sharebnb. \r\n"

                "txt": "Снимали номер с 3 по 9 ноября 2017 втроем - 2 взрослых и ребенок 9 лет. \nМестоположение и район.\nНайти гостиницу очень просто. Если добираетесь сами, то выходить надо на трамвайной остановке Баязит, перейти на другую улицу, найти вывеску Burger King  и по этой улочке идти прямо вниз, никуда не сворачивая, ища вывеску гостиницы (она будет справа). \nТеперь о самом районе. Гостиница находится на торговой и оживленной улице. Первое впечатление - как будто ты попала на рынок, становится тревожно. Но потом уже понимаешь, что собственно это не совсем рынок - это магазины по оптовой торговле обувью. Я несколько раз проходила по этой улочке одна - все нормально - никто меня за руки не хватал, никуда не зазывал - здесь люди торгуют оптом, потому я как покупатель не особо интересна. Прогулка по этой улице до гостиницы занимает минуты 3. Зато поднявшись до трамвайной остановке Баязит, ты попадаешь сразу в исторический центр (Гранд Базар) и можешь прогуляться по одной из самых красивых улиц старого Константинополя. Пешком минут за 10 (может меньше, очень близко) доходим до площади Султанахмет, где в вашем распоряжении сразу несколько достопримечательностей - Храм Святой Софии, Цистерна Базилика, Голубая мечеть, колонны, рядом тоже Дворец Топкапы. Так что в плане местоположения гостиницы - все очень хорошо. И - ночью тихо, никто не мешает спать. В  5 утра кажется проходит молитва - её слышно, но еле-еле, я просто чутко сплю. Мы жили в номере 401 - на верхнем этаже. Из окна открывается вид на Мраморное море со множеством кораблей и крыши соседних домов.\nЗавтраки.\nКаждый день одинаковые, но очень вкусные. Из горячего - яйца, картофель фри, омлет кажется (вроде без молока, не знаю, но вкусно), чай, кофе. Нарезки - огурцы, помидоры, оливки, маслины, 2 вида сыра, колбаса-ветчина, жареные кабачки и перцы, йогурт, хлопья. В кувшинах молоко и еще что-то типа цветного разведенного сока.\nНомер.\nКартинка соответствует полностью нами увиденному. Мебель неновая, но красивая и добротная, и видно, что дорогая. Матрасы толстые и удобные. Белье чистое и не пахнет хлоркой. Могу только добавить, что есть еще мини-бар, чайник электрический и чашки с блюдцами, тройник (поразительно!).  В ванне на троих человек - 5 тюбиков геля и один шампуня, три кусочка мыла и туалетная бумага. Полотенца также предоставляются. Есть сейф, проверили - работает, я так поняла он предоставляется бесплатно....вот только его к шкафу забыли прикрутить -\n спокойно взял под мышку и пошел. Посторонних и неприятных запахов нет.\nВ целом.\nГостиница очень приятная, тихая, уютная. Соотношения цена-качество оптимальное. Рекомендую данную гостиницу."

When we came to check in he said our room was taken and we were to move to another location.  First off, not cool, secondly he didn't offer to give us anything in return for this major inconvenience.  The other place was not up to our standards and we requested a refund which he made in cash.  This was kind of him, but still we want things to run smoothly.  Vacationing is amazing, but it's a costly affair that always adds additional stresses and one stress we like to avoid is accommodation issues."

Restaurants and shops and aquarium are walkable, and most of the spots on the island you want to be at are no more than 20 minutes away by car. We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. \n\nThe space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. \n\nIf you're worried about not having a beach view, don't be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes. \n\nMahalo, Ralph! We'd stay here again <3"

Look no further than this condo because it is a very short walk to the harbor which will cut back travel time and save you money on parking!! I highly recommend dropping by beach bums also located at the harbor for drinks and some delicious BBQ!!! Nice central location on the island makes for easy travel and good time.

This area of the Big Island is lush and tropical and with that beauty comes an abundance of life, so attention must be taken when preparing or storing any kind of food, as the ants will be quick to make an appearance.

You get to wake up with the sound of the waves every morning and watch the beautiful Maui sunsets right on the balcony. The process was really simple and stress-free. The place was immaculate. We really felt at home and got everything we needed and more! I'm really grateful for Sherry and Shane's attention to detail and recommendations about the island.

We're going to miss that. Folks from the north should be aware that there is no A/C here, which is common in Lahanai apparently, we learned, because of the strong trade winds which cool things considerably.

The photos you can see on Sharebnb are very accurate, though they cannot fully capture the breathtaking reality of staying at this accommodation. In this apartment you will fall asleep and wake up to the sound of the waves of the Pacific ocean. You can enjoy an unobstructed view of the setting sun from the balcony while enjoying your dinner and/or a glass of wine/beer/whatever. You can go for a spontaneous swim in the sea, which is only a few steps away from your room.  Sometimes you can even see sea turtles in the water in front of the condo.\n\nThe apartment is perfectly equipped. You'll find everything you need for cooking, doing your laundry, going to the beach (beach towels, beach bags, a cool bag, beach chairs, etc.) and more.\n\nWe will definitely return to Maui in the near future and we hope that we can stay at Sherry's and Shane's condo again. We strongly recommend staying at their condo!"

Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing.

Kihei market was merely a 2 minute walk away as was the surf school where you can rent out paddle boards or surf boards and other gear. Since it is centrally located, driving to other places in Maui was also convenient. \n\nHospitality was outstanding - we knew where we wanted to go but the apt had a Maui guide book on the coffee table for quick reference. There were great amenities to play Music, a nice bookshelf with various reads if you just want to read by the beach and chairs to take to the beach  to relax in between your snorkeling/swimming excursions. \n\nThe views - oh my god. The photos do not do it justice. We had sweeping views of the pacific and saw early morning paddle-boarders, surfers and sea turtles right from the balcony! Im sure if you come during the winter months, you can watch whales literally while drinking your morning coffee. No need to go to an expensive touristy bar to get that perfect Hawaiian sunset :) \n\nI don't know what else to say. Highly recommend for a great time."

The heritage house, very well loved by the owners, is all at once comfortable/cosy, charming and full of wonders… some delicious like: fresh herbs, lemon/orange trees growing in the garden. The'Platypus\" bedroom with its timber walls, vintage lacy mosquito net, clean bed linen & soft towels, made us feel very snug. Ann had even placed some fresh lavender stems on our pillows! We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while. Then, coming back to the house, we were welcomed at night by Ann cooking up a FEAST, literally. She put so much thoughts into the menu and what would please us! The dinner with Ann and her husband was lovely and very much fun. Needless to say that we slept like babies. The next day morning brunch was another delicious meal served on the sunny balcony overlooking the vegetation and the river. We left shortly after and felt we could have stayed for a few more days of true pampering!"

We found it very peaceful and relaxing, and great for an afternoon nap after a long walk!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean, quiet, open, and airy, there was free wifi and Netflix, and basic kitchen amenities, including a coffee maker.

Catherine so you will see homeless people hanging around the church across the street from the condo often. We didn't have any issues though.

I just recently renovated my whole house, pretty much a knock down job so new everything. I heard about air B&B and thought what a great idea. I have a clean house including a great kitchen so feel free to make yourself at home when you stay with me. Just let me know if there is anything in particular you may need. This is also the perfect room to shut yourself away in if that is what you'd prefer.",

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r\n\r\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r\n\r\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Sharebnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n "

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer Nähe vom öffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gràcia\" mit unzähligen Läden, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal für einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Plaça Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. für drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Lluis war bei der Schlüsselübergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps für Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wunderschöne alte Böden und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische Lüftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum („Wintergarten“) ist ein zusätzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gemütlich). Eine schöne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - Stört aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt’s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir können die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n"

The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms roomy for Europe. Our hosts were friendly and willing to help in any way to make our trip enjoyable. Two of our children got ill and the host even made an appointment for us with their pediatrician and emailed to check up on how the kids were feeling after. Now, that's service!

Second, (at least) two times there were unannounced strangers entering the apartment in order to look at it or to even take pictures. We know because we were at the apartment at this time. Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced. In addition to get the key, you have to travel across the city to pick it up - very inconveniently."

The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay. I can recommend the guesthouse for those who travel by themselves and need a quiet room to come back to in the midst of bustling Hong Kong. Thanks a lot, Natalie! All the best, Juliana"
